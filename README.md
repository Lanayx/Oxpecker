# Oxpecker

![Oxpecker](https://github.com/Lanayx/Oxpecker/raw/main/images/oxpecker.png)

**Welcome to Oxpecker!** An F# library designed to supercharge your web development with ASP.NET Core, HTMX, and Solid.js. Oxpecker began as a functional wrapper for ASP.NET Core Endpoint routing (think F#-friendly "Minimal APIs") and has evolved into a comprehensive fullstack solution. Our monorepo includes all related projects, with documentation conveniently located in `README.md` files for each project.

üöÄ **Performance Alert!** Oxpecker is recognized as one of the fastest .NET web frameworks in several categories [in the TechEmpower benchmark](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r23&p=zik0zj-zik0zj-zijocf-zik0zj-zik0zj-18y67).

The server-side core of Oxpecker is a refined version of the acclaimed [Giraffe](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe), largely maintaining Giraffe's successful API (hence the name!). Key enhancements include optimized core types, better performance, simplified handler logic, and the removal of outdated functionalities.
