Oxpecker is a functional wrapper around ASP.NET Core Endpoint routing (sometimes called Minimal API).

This library is basically a revised version of [Giraffe](https://github.com/giraffe-fsharp/Giraffe), it mostly sticks to it's successful API (hence the name). Improvements involve changing some core types, performance of template handlers, simplifying handlers and dropping a lot of outdated functionality.
