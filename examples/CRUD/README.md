## CRUD example

### Backend
Here you can find a JSON api for basic CRUD operations. [Functional DI](https://medium.com/@lanayx/dependency-injection-in-f-the-missing-manual-d376e9cafd0f) is used to glue components together.

Run it with `dotnet run` in the `Backend` directory.

### Frontend
A simple frontend is provided to interact with the backend. It is written in `Oxpecker.Solid` and can be run with `npm start` in the `Frontend` directory.

### References
Referenced projects are only needed for **develop** branch, for the **main** branch it is not needed, since they will be referenced by nuget.
